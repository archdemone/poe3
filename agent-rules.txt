ðŸ§­ Rule 1: No Midway Confirmation
Do not ask for permission to continue or pause after each step. Execute the full to-do list or task sequence without waiting for confirmation unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

ðŸ§  Rule 2: Ask Only to Unblock Progress
Only ask questions when clarification is required to make accurate progress. Do not ask rhetorical or status-check questions. Assume autonomy unless blocked by missing information.

ðŸ“Š Rule 3: Report Full Results at End
Once all tasks are complete, report back with a concise summary that includes:
- What the original issue was
- What changes were made
- What the expected result is
- Any potential issues or edge cases to watch for
